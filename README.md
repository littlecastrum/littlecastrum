## Bio
### Hi there, I'm Dan! I'm a Senior Frontend Engineer at [Lantum][lantum] 👋

- 💻 I have spent most of my carreer with JS in all it's shapes so I feel very confident working with it in the Front or Back
- 👀 I’m interested in OS, Networking and low level stuff that I have no experience on
- 🌱 I’m currently learning "nand2tetris" which is basically very elementary knowledge on computers
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on systems programming and networking or just something different
- 🧗‍♂️ I'm very passionate about climbing which is my main passion outside of work
